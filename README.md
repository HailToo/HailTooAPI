# HailToo

## To build

1. Clone the project: ```git clone git@github.com:HailToo/HailTooAPI.git```
2. Build with gradle: ```./gradlew build```
3. Launch the app: ```./gradlew bootRun```

## Current state

Right now this is just a really generic REST api as a SpringBoot app.
The intent is to enable a multi-concurrent-user stateful game and use JWT to identify which game and player is submitting a move from their client.
